## Problem

Our client (Rathnayaka Shilpiyo) currently relies on a manual ledger system to record payments and manage products, which presents numerous challenges. This outdated method is both time-consuming and prone to errors, such as incorrect transaction entries, unrecorded payments, and discrepancies between recorded stock and actual inventory. These issues can result in dissatisfied customers and missed sales opportunities. Additionally, customers are required to visit the shop in person to purchase items, restricting the business to a local audience and preventing it from reaching potential customers who value traditional wooden crafts but live further away.

The organization also relies on printed posters for event promotion, which is both costly and ineffective. This approach fails to reach a wider audience, often resulting in low participation at events designed to celebrate and share Sri Lanka’s rich cultural heritage. Furthermore, client information is typically gathered informally and communicated through word of mouth, leading to frequent information loss. When customers receive faulty products, they must visit the shop to file complaints, which is inconvenient and inefficient. This outdated system not only hampers customer service but also limits the company’s ability to respond promptly to feedback, slowing its growth and hindering innovation.
